#+TITLE: Chime ðŸ””

A runtime at your service. Chime is a hybrid Virtual Machine that first compiles a chime program
into a sequece of words (32 bits each) and later on interprets it.

It is Turing Complete. As for nice to haves, you have compile-time literals (integers), string support and
syscalls (write and read from stdout).
